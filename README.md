## Local testing notes

Local Jekyll testing setup was completed by following [this post](https://michaelriedl.com/2021/06/11/testing-jekyll.html) (I had trouble following GitHub's default [guides/tutorials](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)).

Make sure the `github-pages` gem is up to date so that what I am previewing locally matches what is actually pushed to the site (more info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#updating-the-github-pages-gem)).
